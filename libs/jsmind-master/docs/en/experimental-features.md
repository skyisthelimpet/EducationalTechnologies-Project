Experimental Features
===

Some contents in the documents are annotated with `experimental`, indicating that those features are currently in experimental stage, which means those features may be changed in the future. The experimental features are neither guaranteed to continue to exist in subsequent versions, nor guaranteed their backward compatibility. If any experimental feature is used in your project, you'd better test them carefully when you upgrade jsmind in the future.
